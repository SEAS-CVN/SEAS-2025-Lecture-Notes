L1 - Overview

Overview: machine learning
What they are, why they are needed, their power & applications, cái gì nằm trong cái gì
what composes a ML algorithm: task, performance measure, experience
unsupervised vs supervised


L2 - Supervised, linear classification
Supervised learning revisit
linear classification
perceptron
mentioned linear regression --> stats 3

L3 - Gradient descent
Training as an optimization problem


L4 - Unsupervised: k-means 
Unsupervised learning revisit: classification vs clustering
k-means, k-NN: 

% sơ sơ, intuition, không đi sâu vô toán
% Chiều exercise: notebook code + visualize k-means, k-NN


L5 - Neural Nets
Remind linear models --> Feature representation --> motivate neural nets --> few words about backprop


% Chiều exercise:
% giải toán backpropagation notebook


L6

?? Training, evaluation, tradeoffs
training, fine-tuning, evaluation
model class, model capacity, bias & variance, error decomposition overfitting, underfitting
Chiều exercise:
maybe quiz situational trường hợp nào overfit, underfit, trường hợp nào high bias etc.


?? Deep Learning
DL vs ML
From MLP to CNN
